# Shop_Revenue_prediction_IronKaggle
Machine Learning exercise 

## ABOUT
The objective is to predict the revenue of shops.
Group project made in class : [B.Pardelhas](https://github.com/bmpardelhas), [Luciefley](https://github.com/luciefley) <br>
5 hours to deliver the results

## DATA 
Dataset was given during class. (640840 rows X9 columns)
See Data_description.txt 

## MAIN STEPS

- Dataset exploration
- Data cleaning
- Selecting the model 
- Trainning + testing the model
- Improving Predictions, Feature engineering 
- Delivering the results

## TECHNIQUES AND TOOLS

- Data visualization : correlation matrix, heatmap, pairplots - [Matplotlib, Seaborn]
- Pycaret
- Model : xgboost (extreme gradient boosting)
